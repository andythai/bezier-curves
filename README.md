# bezier-curves

This project functions like a simple track editor. It renders 10 bezier curves, with approximately 1500 line segments. Each curve has 4 control points which can be manipulated by mouse. 

<b>The controls:</b>

Clicking and dragging the mouse without clicking on a point will drag the camera.


X - will toggle movement in the x-axis only.

C - will toggle movement in the y-axis only.

B - will show the sphere.

P - will pause sphere movement.

O - will reset the sphere to the highest point in the curve.

R - will reset the camera.
